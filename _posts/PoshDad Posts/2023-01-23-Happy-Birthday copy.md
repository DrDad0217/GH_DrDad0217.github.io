Dear Mama,

FIRST OFF HAPPY BIRTHDAY :Birthday: :Rocket:
I want to say thank you for the following reasons...

- For always treating me like a son and as one of your own.
- For showing us how we should treat others with Love,Respect and kindness.
- Treating me like royalty whenever I am at the Lake house, making me yummy food and all of the Blueberry coffees I stole from you.
- Bringing Penny surprises and watching her when Cherie has to run errands.
- Thank you for being you...
